# Exodus Town - App

In the digital tapestry of the Metaverse, the Exodus Town interface stands as the portal to a new epoch. This repository is the forge where code alchemists shape the tools of interaction with Exodus Town.

### Codex Overview

Within these digital halls lies the machinery of interaction for the settlers of Exodus Town. Crafted upon the anvil of Cloudflare Pages, the interface is a bastion of serverless might, with Cloudflare Functions as its sentinels. The webapp, a tapestry woven with Vite, React, and the arcane art of hooks, awaits your command.

### Enchantments and Runes

- **Auction Engagement**: The interface is your grimoire, guiding your hand in the sacred art of the auction, where parcels of the new world are claimed.
- **Content Conjuration**: For those with the TOWN token talisman, the interface becomes a wand, allowing you to breathe life into parcels with your creations.
- **Lore Updates**: With every cycle of the sun and moon, the interface whispers the latest happenings of Exodus Town to those who listen.

### Forging the Key

To wield the power of this interface:

- Clone the essence of this repository to your sanctum.
- Transcribe the ancient script `.dev.vars.example` into `.dev.vars`, infusing it with the necessary environment runes for the backend sanctum.
- To harmonize the frontiers of the frontend realm, edit the scrolls within `src/config/env/dev.json` and `src/config/env/prd.json` with the wisdom of configuration.
- Invoke `npm install` to align the stars and gather the necessary elements.
- Chant `npm run dev` to awaken the spirits within and step through the portal to your local realm.

### Scroll of Collaboration

This repository thrives on the contributions of fellow travelers and code conjurers. If the call to adventure stirs within you, consult the contribution scrolls for guidance.

### Aid and Consultation

Should you encounter beasts or bewilderments, inscribe your trials in an issue within these halls, and a guardian will come to your aid.

### Tome of the Law
