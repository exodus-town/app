In the year of our digital epoch 2023, Monotributista, Deployer of Exodus Town, hath decreed the following:

Hear ye, hear ye, those who by fate or fortune lay hands upon this tome of software and its accompanying scrolls (hereafter known as the ‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù). Ye are granted, without the need for coin or tribute, the unfettered right to wield, replicate, transmute, intertwine, herald, distribute, bestow, and/or trade copies of the Software. Ye are also empowered to grant others passage to the fruits of this Software, all within the realms of freedom, provided ye uphold the following runes:

The sacred script of copyright and this charter of permission shall accompany all copies or significant fragments of the Software.

Let it be known, the Software is bestowed as a gift, ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù, without warranties or guarantees from the arcane to the mundane, not limited to the merchantability, suitability for a purpose ordained, or non-violation of hidden covenants. By no means shall the scribes or the rightful stewards be held accountable for any claims, damages, or other boundless liabilities, whether in a pact of commerce, grievance, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the dealings therein.

So it is written, so it shall be. üìú‚ú®
